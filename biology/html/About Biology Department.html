A Bachelor of Science in Biology prepares students for careers in cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, plant and animal biology, genetics, physiology, secondary education, ecology and field biology.
                        </p>
                        <p class="program-desc">
Students may also prepare for medical, dental, veterinary, agricultural, or other professional and graduate schools. The major establishes a foundation for interdisciplinary careers in biological resources management, human biology, nutritional sciences, science communications and technical writing. Many students may be employed in industry (pharmaceutical, hospitals, clinics, and others), government agencies, environmental consulting firms, as well as education.
                        </p>
                        <p class="program-desc">
Christians bring desperately needed morals and ethical values into the workplace. It is, therefore, imperative that they continue to become employed in the biological sciences as the need to morally evaluate issues continues to arise (in vitro fertilization, The Human Genome Project and cloning, etc.). It is crucial that we seed the scientific community with students that have a Christian perspective to help shape the future of science in the 21st century.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="heading-text">Mission</h3>
                        <p class="program-desc">
The purpose of the biology program at North Greenville University is to offer a distinctive, innovative program that attracts students and meets the needs of students and the community. In keeping with the institution’s Statement of Purpose, this program seeks to enable students to integrate academic disciplines, Christian lifestyle, and an enriched cultural experience by offering course work that produces well-rounded biologists for the future. The students are taught with a Christian perspective, where they can learn an appreciation for God’s creation and complexity of life.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="heading-text">Program Goals</h3>
                        <p class="program-desc">
To produce graduates proficient in the field of biology who can successfully compete for positions in the field of the biological sciences. Such positions will include graduate, medical, dental and veterinary schools as well as industrial vocations.
