Dr. Kristen G. van den Meiracker has been teaching students of all ages for over 25 years. She began her teaching career as a middle and high school Biology teacher after finishing her master's degree at Converse College. She taught these younger students for five years before deciding to pursue her doctorate in entomology, specifically termites (and other urban pests). Dr. van den Meiracker continued to teach as an assistant in various courses and labs throughout her Ph.D., but also worked in the urban entomology research lab at Clemson University as a research assistant. She was awarded a post-doctoral fellowship at Clemson after finishing her Ph.D. and continued termite baiting research during this time, working with Drs. Patricia Zungoli and Eric Benson.

Dr. van den Meiracker worked as an urban entomologist for Terminix Service in Columbia, SC after completing her post-doc. During this time she assisted other entomologists with teaching pest control operators insect, pesticide, and safety information. Though she enjoyed her time at Terminix and loved the people she worked with, Dr. van den Meiracker felt the familiar tug of needing to teach young people again – this time at the college level.

Dr. van den Meiracker began teaching full-time at North Greenville University in August 2000, and assisted the Biology Department with developing a Biology major. Dr. van den Meiracker – or “Dr. V.” as called by her students – has several peer-reviewed published articles on termite baiting. Along with teaching, she serves as a mentor to undergraduate research students in the areas of freshwater sponge gemmulation and termites. She has served as faculty chair, received the Lamar S. Chapman Meritorious Faculty Member Award, and continues to serve on University committees. Dr. van den Meiracker thoroughly enjoys working with her colleagues at NGU and is so proud of how the Biology department has continued to grow and students succeed.
