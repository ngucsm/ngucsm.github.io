Dr. Monica Ragin joined North Greenville
University as an Assistant Professor in 2013. She earned her Bachelors
of Science in Biology in 2006 at Presbyterian College. After which, she
worked as a post-baccalaureate PREP Scholar, conducting complementary
and alternative medicinal research (medical botany) and was trained in
immunohistochemical laboratory techniques at Palmetto Richland Hospital
(Columbia, SC). Dr. Ragin began graduate school as a Biomedical Sciences
student in 2009 at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine
and earned her PhD in Biological Sciences at the University of South
Carolina in 2012. Her dissertation work is entitled &quot;The Potential Role
of Insulin (and Stress Response) Pathway Components in Breast Cancer
Development and Progression.&quot;
