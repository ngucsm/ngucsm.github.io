Dr. Jan M. Foster has a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Biology from Erskine College. Dr. Foster moved to Augusta, Georgia to earn her Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences from the Medical College of Georgia in the field of protein regulation of renal and cardiovascular physiology. During this time, she attended Northside Baptist Church in Greenwood, SC where she felt a strong pull towards incorporating her faith into her understanding of human physiology. She decided to begin her teaching career in Christian higher education at North Greenville University. She joined the Biology Department in 2009 where she is teaching biology and health and wellness majors as well as courses for non-science majors.
