Dr. Nathaniel joined North Greenville University in 2012 shortly after she earned her PhD in Biology from Bowling Green State University in Ohio. Dr. Nathaniel’s research interest spans the field of ecological genetics and developmental biology. Due to her fascination with how the environment can modify processes that are pertinent to life, her research focuses on understanding the mechanisms involved in plant defense responses to biotic and abiotic stress, effects of drugs of abuse on developmental processes, and the biology of drug addiction. She has used different biological systems including, the androdioecous Datisca glomerata, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and simple invertebrate systems like crayfish and Caenorhabditis elegans. Findings from these studies are published in peer-reviewed journals. She is an active member of various academic societies.
