Dr. Christina Eddy, Ph.D. began teaching at NGU in the fall of 2005. She has a B.A. with a double major in Biology and Chemistry from Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa and a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from Marquette University. Dr. Eddy along with Mrs. Mar Pinner, have co-authored a lab manual for the introductory biology lab.

                        <p class="faculty-info-text">
Dr. Eddy incorporates teaching, research and missions to give as many students as possible the opportunity to apply critical thinking and the scientific method to solve practical problems and prepare to share the gospel by meeting the physical needs of people around the world. Each year Dr. Eddy mentors several research students in individual projects. Most of her research is focused on testing and improving simple methods of removing contaminates from drinking water.

                        <p class="faculty-info-text">
Millions of people do not have consistent access to safe drinking water. Dr. Eddy and her students are testing Moringa seeds which can remove over 90% of dirt and bacteria from contaminated water in 1 hour. Other methods being investigated include solar disinfection and biosand filters. In 2011, Dr. Eddy led a team of seven students to India where they demonstrated the use of Moringa seed to a village that had only contaminated river water to drink. In December 2014, seven additional students went with Dr. Eddy to India to share Godâ€™s love and demonstrate how water quality can be improved by use of Moringa seeds. God is opening many doors of opportunities for students to apply what they learn in their research projects as they go on other mission trips.

                        <p class="faculty-info-text">
Prior to coming to NGU Dr. Eddy taught at Mississippi State University, Skidmore College, and Red Rocks Community College. She has been a research scientist at a biotech company and the National Renewable Energy Lab. Prior to coming to NGU her research involved developing recombinant organisms to produce ethanol for fuel and vitamins. She is an inventor on several patents including one for development of an organism to produce ethanol from wood and plant waste materials. The technology is currently being used by DuPont Chemical Company as part of a bio-refinery opening this year in Iowa.
